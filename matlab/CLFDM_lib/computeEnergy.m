function [V Vdot] = compute_lyapunov(X,Xd,Vxf)
% Syntax:
%
%       [V Vdot] = compute_lyapunov(X,Xd,Vxf)
%
% This function computes the energy value at query point(s) X, given the energy
% (Lyapunov) function Vxf. When Xd is passed as an empty variable, it also
% provides the energy gradient (i.e. Vdot = dV). Otherwise, it computes the
% rate of change in energy by moving along Xd.
%
% Inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o X:       d x N matrix representing N different query point(s)
%
%   o Xd:      d x N matrix representing the velocities at the query points.
%              Note that Xd could also be passed as an empty variable.
%              Xd is used to compute the rate of change in the energy by
%              moving along the velocity vector, i.e. Vdot = dV/dx . dx/dt.
%              If Xd = [], then Vdot = dV/dx is given as the output
%
%   o Vxf:     A structure variable representing the energy function. This
%              structure should follow the format explained in optimize_lyapunov.m
%
% Outputs ----------------------------------------------------------------
%
%   o V:       A 1 x N array representing the energy values at the query points. 
%
%   o Vdot:    A 1 x N array representing the rate of change in energy at
%              the query points by moving along the velocity vector Xd.
%              When Xd is passed as an empty variable, then it is d x N
%              matrix, where each column corresponds to the energy gradient
%              (i.e. Vdot = dV) at each query point.
