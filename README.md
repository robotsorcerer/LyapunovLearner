### Introduction

This code largely reimplements Learning CLFs using SEDS paper by Khansari-Zadeh. See original code in [matlab here](https://bitbucket.org/khansari/clfdm/src/master/demo_CLFDM_Learning.m).

### Running Lyapunov Learner

 + Please run in a `python 3.6` environment.

 + If you run the [demo.py](/scripts/demo.py) file with the `w` model, you should obtain a chart similar to this:

   ![results_python](/scripts/docs/energy_levels.png)

or with the `s` model, you should obtain a chart similar to this:
